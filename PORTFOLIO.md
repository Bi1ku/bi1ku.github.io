# Owen Shi — Engineering & Projects

A project-focused portfolio, built with React, TypeScript, and vinext. Projects, experience, and background are visible on a single page.

## Development

Run `npm ci`, then `npm run dev`. Run `npm run build` for the deployment build and `npm test` for the server-rendering smoke test.

## Content

The biography, experience, education, and skill details come from Owen_Shi_Resume.pdf, with current Harvard club roles supplied directly by Owen in October 2026. Featured repositories were checked against https://github.com/Bi1ku on September 14, 2026. Edit `app/page.tsx` to update project and experience content, and `app/globals.css` to change the theme. Replace `public/Owen_Shi_Resume.pdf` to update the download.

The model rocket project is Owen’s C6-5 build, with project details and media supplied in October 2026. Its Onshape CAD image and browser-compatible H.264/AAC launch video live in `public/projects/rocket/`; the project section includes an inline CAD preview and a playable launch video.

## GitHub Pages

The public website is https://bi1ku.github.io/. `npm run dev:pages` starts the static development server; `npm run build:pages` creates `dist-pages/`. GitHub Actions builds and deploys each push to `main`. Select **GitHub Actions** under **Settings → Pages → Source** in the repository.

This build reuses the same portfolio component and stylesheet without requiring a server. The original vinext/Sites build remains available through `npm run build`.

## HUAC flight computer

The featured avionics flight computer was designed by Owen for HUAC Rocketry’s IREC 10k rocket. Its schematic, routed PCB screenshot, and 3D render were supplied from Owen’s Desktop in November 2026 and are stored in `public/projects/avionics/`. Hardware descriptions are based on those images. The page does not claim completed firmware, bench testing, or flight validation.

## Requiem demo

The Requiem section includes an 11-second GIF with explicit play/stop controls and a static poster. It does not autoplay. Assets and captured command output live in `public/projects/requiem/`. To regenerate with Pillow installed, run `python3 scripts/generate-requiem-demo.py /path/to/built/requiem`. The capture records the compiler commit and actual outputs; playback timing is illustrative, not a benchmark.

## SpringForge demo

Owen’s screen recording is embedded beneath the SpringForge description with native playback controls, a still poster, and a full-size video link. The original MP4 and extracted poster are in `public/projects/springforge/`. The section also links to the live GlowScript app. Playback is user-initiated.
